In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **just-in-time** (**JIT**) **compilation** (also **dynamic translation** or **run-time compilations**) [compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") (of [computer code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")) during execution of a program (at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase) "Run time (program lifecycle phase)")) rather than before execution. This may consist of [source code translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_translation "Source code translation") but is more commonly [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode") translation to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code"), which is then executed directly. A system implementing a JIT compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.
